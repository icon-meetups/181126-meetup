Q&A

Q) I do not know why I should use a blockchain. What is the difference between cyber money and blockchain?

A) It is a meaningful technology as it can provide a service that no one can control. In the past, the entire system shut down with one server problem. In addition, utilizing disruptive technology such as blockchain is rising issue in many industries. Numerous companies work on how to establish new business model fits into blockchain. 

 
Q) Reliability is the most attractive aspect of the blockchain. Doesn’t it cause a reliability dilemma when the central control takes part.

A) This may seem like an ironic situation. However, computing power is essential to run the system and hence it involves other companies. It is compulsory for all nodes to participate in consensus. However, there exists parties such as Custom Service that want only certain nodes to see everything and associated companies to see some.
